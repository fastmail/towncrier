A simple status dashboard.

## features

- Standalone - just Perl and some modules, no web server or database required
- REST API - including a public read-only one
- RSS feeds

## setup

### Existing Perl with Carton

If you have a system with a fairly recent Perl already, then Carton is your
next best choice:

```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/robn/towncrier.git
$ cd towncrier
$ curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - Carton
$ carton install --deployment
$ carton exec plackup bin/app.pl
```
For production you'll need to know a little more about Perl webapp deployment.
Go and read the docs for Carton and Dancer::Deployment.

### anything else

Get Perl, get all the dependencies, run the program. This is the developer
option, and you're expected to know what you're doing :)

Expect to install the development packages for `libxml2` and `expat` for your
distribution as well as `make` and `gcc`.

### first run

You need to install the initial statuses and services. Look at bin/fixtures.sh
to get started.

There's some knobs you can twiddle in config.yml.
